# Functional $\alpha$-transformations for the statistical analysis of density functions: comparison with the log-ratio approach.

## Abstract
The well established Aitchison geometry and the log-ratio approach are considered to be the baseline theory to deal with Compositional Data. 
Recent advances led to the introduction of the $\alpha$-transformations, a family of Box-Cox like transformations that range from the log-ratio to a simple Euclidean transformation, based on the parameter $\alpha$. 
The main strengths of this family when compared with the log-ratio approach, are firstly to allow to select the degree of data modification based on the problem at hand, and to be able to deal with zeros in the composition. 
The log-ratio approach has been extended to the functional case, in which compositions with infinitely-many parts become probability density functions. Similarly to the multivariate case, the constraints presented by density functions prevent the classical Functional Data Analysis techniques to work properly.
The Bayes space has been introduced as the extension of the Aitchison simplex in order to embed densities in a suitable geometry.
The primary goal of this work is to introduce the functional version of the $\alpha$-transformations as a generalization of the theory develeped in the multivariate framework. A case study is presented in order to test the transformations against the log-ratio approach both in functional regression and in time-series forecasting.
